The installation process enables cephx by default, so that the cluster requires user authentication and authorization by all client applications.

Ceph uses user accounts for several purposes:

For internal communication between Ceph daemons. (Ex: osd.1 or mgr.mon2.dndgpu )

For client applications accessing the cluster through the librados library. (client.XXX

For cluster administrators.(client.admin)


A- User Management

To list existing user accounts, run the ceph auth list command:
[ceph: root@node /]# ceph auth list

To get the details of a specific account, use the ceph auth get command:
[ceph: root@node /]# ceph auth get client.admin

You can print the secret key:
[ceph: root@node /]# ceph auth print-key client.admin


To export and import user accounts, run the ceph auth export and ceph auth import
commands:
[ceph: root@node /]# ceph auth export client.operator1 > ~/operator1.export
[ceph: root@node /]# ceph auth import -i ~/operator1.export

1- Creating New User Accounts
The ceph auth get-or-create command creates a new user account and generates its secret
key. The command prints this key to stdout by default, so it is common to add the -o option to
save standard output to a key-ring file.

This example creates the app1 user account with read and write access to all pools, and stores the
key-ring file in /etc/ceph/ceph.client.app1.keyring:

[ceph: root@node /]# ceph auth get-or-create client.app1 \
mon 'allow r' osd 'allow rw' -o /etc/ceph/ceph.client.app1.keyring
Authentication requires the key-ring file, so you must copy the file to all client systems that
operate with this new user account.

2-Modifying User Capabilities
Modify the capabilities of a user account with the ceph auth caps command.

This example modifies the app1 user account capabilities on OSDs to allow only read and write
access to the myapp pool:
[ceph: root@node /]# ceph auth caps client.app1 mon 'allow r' \
osd 'allow rw pool=myapp'

The ceph auth caps command overwrites existing capabilities When using this command, you
must specify the full set of capabilities for all daemons, not only those you want to modify. Define
an empty string to remove all capabilities:
[ceph: root@node /]# ceph auth caps client.app1 osd ''


3-Deleting User Accounts
The ceph auth del command deletes a user account:
[ceph: root@node /]# ceph auth del client.app1



C- Restricting Access

Restrict user OSD permissions such that users can only access the pools they need. This example
creates the formyapp2 user and limits their access to read and write on the myapp pool:
[ceph: root@node /]# ceph auth get-or-create client.formyapp2 \
mon 'allow r' osd 'allow rw pool=myapp'

If you do not specify a pool when you configure capabilities, then Ceph sets them on all existing
pools.
The cephx mechanism can restrict access to objects by other means:
• By object name prefix. The following example restricts access to only those objects whose
names start with pref in any pool.
[ceph: root@node /]# ceph auth get-or-create client.formyapp3 \
mon 'allow r' osd 'allow rw object_prefix pref'
• By namespace. Implement namespaces to logically group objects within a pool. You can then
restrict user accounts to objects belonging to a specific namespace:
[ceph: root@node /]# ceph auth get-or-create client.designer \
mon 'allow r' osd 'allow rw namespace=photos'
• By path. The Ceph File System (CephFS) utilizes this method to restrict access to specific
directories. This example creates a new user account, webdesigner, that can access only the /
webcontent directory and its contents:
[ceph: root@node /]# ceph fs authorize cephfs client.webdesigner /webcontent rw
[ceph: root@node /]# ceph auth get client.webdesigner
exported keyring for client.webdesigner
[client.webdesigner]
 key = AQBrVE9aNwoEGRAApYR6m71ECRzUlLpp4wEJkw==
 caps mds = "allow rw path=/webcontent"
 caps mon = "allow r"
 caps osd = "allow rw pool=cephfs_data"
• By Monitor command. This method restricts administrators to a specific list of commands. The
following example creates the operator1 user account and limits its access to two commands:
[ceph: root@node /]# ceph auth get-or-create client.operator1 \
mon 'allow r, allow command "auth get-or-create", allow command "auth list"'



LAB: Configure two users for an application with the following capabilites. 
The first user, client.docedit, stores and retrieves documents in the docs namespace of the replpool1 pool. 

The second user, client.docget, only retrieves documents from the replpool1 pool.
