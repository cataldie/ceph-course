---------------------------- ADD OSDs to cluster-------------------
Ceph requires that the following conditions are met to consider a storage device:

• The device must not have any partitions.
• The device must not have any LVM state.
• The device must not be mounted.
• The device must not contain a file system.
• The device must not contain a Ceph BlueStore OSD.
• The device must be larger than 5 GB


Run the ceph orch device ls command from the cephadm shell to list the available devices.
The --wide option provides more device detail.

1-List the device

# ceph orch device ls


 #ceph orch device ls --hostname=ceph-osd1
 
 2- ADD devices to cluster
 
 run the ceph orch apply osd --all-available-devices command to deploy OSDs on all available and unused devices.
 
 # ceph orch apply osd --all-available-devices
 
 This command creates an OSD service called osd.all-available-devices and enables the
Orchestrator service to manage all OSD provisioning. The Orchestrator automatically creates
OSDs from both new disk devices in the cluster.

$ ceph orch ls

To disable the Orchestrator from automatically provisioning OSDs, set the unmanaged flag to true.

# ceph orch apply osd --all-available-devices --unmanaged=true
