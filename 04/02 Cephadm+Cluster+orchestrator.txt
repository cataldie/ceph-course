---------------------------Ceph Orchestrator----------------------
The cephadm utility consists of two main components:
• The cephadm shell.
• The cephadm orchestrator.

The cephadm orchestrator provides a command-line interface to the orchestrator ceph-mgr modules, 
which interface with external orchestration services. The purpose of an orchestrator is
to coordinate configuration changes that must be performed cooperatively across multiple nodes
and services in a storage cluster.

[root@node ~]# cephadm shell
/]#


To run a single command, use the cephadm shell command followed by two dashes and the
Ceph command.
]# cephadm shell -- CEPH_COMMAND
